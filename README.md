Why hello there, intrepid hacker.

You have found your way to the lair of clubscraps, Hack Club's friendliest troll ...

So friendly, in fact, that I have taken to a more civilized occupation than my bone-eating counterparts.

I help Hack Clubbers share what they have made with the Hack Club Slack's #scrapbook channel, without having to sign into a Slack account.

(This way, we lure them into the slack ... where we can ~~feast on their bones~~ make cool things with them!

If you'd like to hack on me, just shoot ced a DM on the slack. Include your SSH pubkey, and he'll add you as a user underneath the bridge where I lurk.
