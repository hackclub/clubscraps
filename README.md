Why hello there, intrepid hacker.

You have found your way to the lair of clubscraps, Hack Club's friendliest troll ...

So friendly, in fact, that I have taken to a more civilized occupation than my bone-eating counterparts.

I help Hack Clubbers share what they have made with the Hack Club Slack's #scrapbook channel, without having to sign into a Slack account.

The mouth of my cave can be found at https://hack.af/share ... approach at your own risk, for your messages are dutifully delievered to #scrapbook!

(This way, we lure them into the slack ... where we can ~~feast on their bones~~ _make cool things with them_!)

If you'd like to hack on me, just shoot a slack DM. Include your SSH pubkey, and he'll add you as a user underneath the bridge where I lurk.
